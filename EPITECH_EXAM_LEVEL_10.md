Be careful to the goal of the function or program.

Take 5 min to check everything is going to be ok before pushing.




####Exercise 1)

|my_convert_string_to_number|
|:----|
|Write a function which converts the given parameters to number and returns it
|FOLDER     :   ex_01
|BINARY NAME:
|
|NAME       :   my_convert_string_to_number
|PARAMETER  :   string
|RETURN     :   number





####Exercise 2)

|my_show_number|
|:----|
|Write a function which displays a number  
|
|FOLDER     :   ex_02
|BINARY NAME:
|
|NAME       :   my_show_number
|PARAMETER  :   number
|RETURN     :  





####Exercise 3)

|my_square_root|
|:----|
|Write a function which returns a square root of given parameter  
|
|FOLDER     :   ex_03
|BINARY NAME:
|
|NAME       :   my_square_root
|PARAMETER  :   string
|RETURN     :   number




####Exercise 4)

|my_splitString_to_array|
|:----|
|Write a program which splits a string in two when it found a *=* and transform it to array

|BINARY NAME:
|
|NAME       :   my_splitString_to_array
|PARAMETER  :   string
|RETURN     :   array





####Exercise 5)

|my_pythagorean_theorem|
|:----|
|Write a program which calculates the size of hypotenuse from the right triangle
|advise : BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2
|----------------------
|example : 
|./ex_05 "AC=3" "AB=5" "BC=hypotenuse"
|the size of hypotenuse (BC) is around 5.8 cm, exactly square root of 34 cm   
|----------------------
|
|FOLDER     :   ex_05
|BINARY NAME:   ex_05
|
|NAME       :   my_pythagorean_theorem
|PARAMETER  :   number
|RETURN     :
