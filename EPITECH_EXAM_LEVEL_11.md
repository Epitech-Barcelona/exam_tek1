|----------------------
|example : 
|./ex_01 "4" "3"
|XXXXX
|X   X
|XXXXX
|----------------------
|FOLDER     :   ex_01

|PARAMETER  :   
|RETURN     :




####Exercise 2)

|my_convert_string_to_number|
|:----|
|Write a function which converts the given parameters to number and returns it
|The function return 0 when it can't convert
|FOLDER     :   ex_02
|BINARY NAME:
|

|PARAMETER  :   string
|RETURN     :   number

|PARAMETER  :   
|RETURN     :  





####Exercise 4)

|:----|
|Write a program which displays the number of occurrences of each character in given arguments.
|The function will finish with a line break
|----------------------
|example : 
|./ex_04 "toto" "titi"

|i : 2
|----------------------

|
|NAME       :   my_display_number_of_occurrences
|RETURN     :   




####Exercise 5)

|my_array_without_duplication|
|:----|

|advise : BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2
|----------------------
|example : 
|./ex_06 "AC=3" "AB=5" "BC=hypotenuse"
|the size of hypotenuse (BC) is around 5.8 cm, exactly square root of 34 cm   
|----------------------
|
|FOLDER     :   ex_06
|BINARY NAME:   ex_06
|
|NAME       :   my_pythagorean_theorem
